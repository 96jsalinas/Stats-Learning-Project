# Project Plan: Credit Card Default Prediction

## General Information
* **Tools:** We use Python 3 for all analysis and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) for the report generation.
* **Deadline:** March 2nd.
* **Structure:** In each chapter, we will first write a brief introduction of the goals, followed by the analysis, and conclude with a summary of the findings.

## Execution Plan

1.  **Finish up EDA**
    Expand on the initial analysis with more graphs and information, we can base the approach on the projects we did for Multivariate and Regression.

2.  **Transform Data**
    Normalize the dataset to avoid issues arising from different variable units.

3.  **LDA / QDA / Naive Bayes**
    Implement and compare Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and Naive Bayes classifiers.

4.  **Cost-Sensitive Learning / Imbalances**
    Address the class imbalance in the dataset using cost-sensitive learning techniques.

5.  **kNN**
    Implement and evaluate the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.

6.  **Conclusion**
    Summarize the overall results and findings of the project.
